# DNC Coffee ☕️ 

## 🔥 To do:
 The company DNC hired you to give some "life" on the elements from a Cafeteria website, it's necessary develop some features.

 It was necessary to show a button when the user pass the mouse on card, and open a custom modal using Javascript to get information about the cafeteria.

 The Figma's project was already given. 

 ## 😜 What I've learned working on this project:
 ✅  How to create modals from zero.
 ✅  Create functions to open and close modal using querySelector
 ✅  Work with Event listener to close modal when clicked out of it

 ## ⚡️ Techs:
 ✅ Bootstrap installed by NPM (Node Package Manager)
 ✅ Javascript
 ✅ CSS

 Hope you enjoy as much as I have! ⭐
